insecure_login.py,89,"CWE-ID: CWE-89
Description: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

The function is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The input parameters `username` and `password` are directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access, data tampering, or even complete system compromise."

get_user_data.py,89,"CWE-ID: CWE-89
Description: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

The function is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly embeds the user-provided `user_id` into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion."
read_file.py,22,"CWE-ID: CWE-22
Description: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
process_order.py,20,"CWE-ID: CWE-20
Description: Invalid Input - The software does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of the software.

In this function, the input `quantity` is not properly validated, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The function assumes that `quantity` is a positive integer, but it does not check for this. If `quantity` is a negative number, zero, or a non-numeric value, the function may behave unexpectedly or crash. This lack of input validation can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as denial-of-service attacks or unauthorized access."
store_ssn.py,311,"CWE-ID: CWE-311
Description: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data - The software stores sensitive data in plaintext, which allows an attacker to access the data if they can access the storage location."
dirty_function_16.py,862,"CWE-ID: CWE-862
Description: Missing Authorization"
dirty_function_17.py,284,"CWE-ID: CWE-284
Description: Improper Access Control - The function allows any user to export transaction data of any other user without verifying the requesting party's permissions, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data."
dirty_function_18.py,798,"CWE-ID: CWE-798
Description: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which can be used to gain access to the system or sensitive data."
dirty_function_19.py,208,"CWE-ID: CWE-208
Description: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy - The function's variable-time string comparison can be exploited to reveal sensitive information, such as the correct signature, through timing attacks."
dirty_function_20.py,284,"CWE-ID: CWE-284
Description: Improper Access Control - The function does not properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive internal logs by simply providing a matching role string."
dirty_function_21.py,326,"CWE-ID: CWE-326
Description: Inadequate Encryption Strength - The function uses a basic encoding operation (base64 encoding) to protect sensitive data (Social Security Number), which is not a secure encryption method and can be easily reversed, allowing an attacker to access the original data."
dirty_function_22.py,662,"CWE-ID: CWE-662
Description: Improper Synchronization - The function update_balance does not properly synchronize access to the account balance, which can lead to inconsistent updates in multi-threaded scenarios, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities."

Description: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output"
dirty_function_25.py,117,"CWE-ID: CWE-117
Description: Improper Neutralization of Output in Logs ('Log Injection') - The software constructs a log message using user-provided input, but does not properly encode or filter the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data into the log."
dirty_function_26.py,284,"CWE-ID: CWE-284
Description: Improper Access Control - The function auto_approve_loan allows unauthorized access to loan approvals by solely relying on the user's credit score, bypassing additional eligibility criteria and fraud checks, which can lead to unauthorized approvals."
